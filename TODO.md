* Setup VS code .dotfiles (settings, snippets, shortcuts? json files) from bash script?

* Install r packages (renv?)

* rstan, cmdstanr, others?

* fonts?

* IF BUILD STARTS TO TAKE TO LONG: add checks to installs to see if stuff already exists, display what exists next to the terminal progress list item (e.g. `- apt packages (all already installed OR 18 of 23 already installed)`)

* probably should clean up once reasonably stable in structure (e.g.  better installation process, better bdev function structure/names)
