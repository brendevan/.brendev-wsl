* Install okular

* Setup codium .dotfiles (settings, snippets, shortcuts? json files) from bash script?

* Setup codium extensions from bash script

* Switch on windows from code to codium

* Look into renv for rpackage management

* radian customisation (prompt, startup message)

* fonts?

* Add option to only install what isn't already installed (e.g. bdev-build --no-update)? Display what exists next to the terminal progress list item (e.g. `- apt packages (all already installed OR 18 of 23 already installed)`)

* Clean up aliases (especially bdev stuff)

* Add in `bdev-update-r` alias which updates r and packages. Then in main install script only install missing packages

* Add msg's for system packages (like R packages)

* KEYBINDINGS: 
    - Figure out how to remove all keybindings in vscode and start fresh
    - Windows: remap CAPSLOCK to f13, this is then the termanal key (F13 + 1 = zsh; f13+2 = r terminal; etc)
